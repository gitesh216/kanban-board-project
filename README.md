# Kanban Board Project

## 📌 Overview
This is a **drag-and-drop Kanban board** built with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and move tasks between columns (**To Do, In Progress, Done**). Tasks are stored in **Local Storage**, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Add New Tasks** – Users can add tasks with a title, description, and priority (High, Medium, Low).  
✅ **Edit & Update Tasks** – Modify existing tasks easily.  
✅ **Delete Tasks** – Remove tasks with confirmation.  
✅ **Drag & Drop** – Move tasks across different columns.  
✅ **Local Storage Support** – Tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.
